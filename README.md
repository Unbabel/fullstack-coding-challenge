# Unbabel Fullstack Challenge

Hey :smile:

Welcome to our Fullstack Challenge repository. This README will guide you on how to participate in this challenge.

In case you are doing this for our open positions for a Fullstack, make sure you first apply to the available jobs @ https://unbabel.com/jobs/.


<!--If you're in the process, then by now we have got a better appreciation of who
you are and now we would like to get a feel for the way you work. To do this, we
would like to challenge you to collaborate with us on solving a problem that
we've encountered before.

Please understand that this is not a test or an exam, here there are no right and wrong
answers. This is just an opportunity for us to collaborate together and solve an interesting
problem. You also can get an understanding of the type of things we have to do in Talkdesk,
being a startup and all.

What we expect to learn about you from this is:

* Your working style
* How you think and solve problems
* How you communicate

And what we expect you'll learn about us is:

* How we work as a team
* The types of problems we deal with

## Next Steps

0. Read the [list](problems/) and choose a problem to solve
0. You'll be given a link to a private repository which you can clone and work
   on to submit your challenge.
0. Open an Issue in your new repo with the problem you've chosen. You can use this
   issue to discuss the problem at hand or for asking questions.
0. Solve the problem any way you like, but do the best you can and try to take
   into consideration some of our [development practices](docs/development_practices.md).
   This means you can use any language, tools, libraries, etc. you need to get the job
   done with (although please don't choose something too esoteric as we need to be
   able to understand the great work you'll do :smiley: - the languages our team is familiar with are: Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C#, C, C++, PHP, Python, Node, Elixir and Scala - if you want to do it in a different language, please check with us first).
0. As is mentioned in the [development practices](docs/development_practices.md), you should be doing the development of this in a topic branch. Once you have something in your branch, you can open a Pull Request (to your own master branch) any time you like. You can use this pull request to discuss something code specific, or if you'd like some feedback on your code.
0. Once you have something more substantial to show, make sure you have a pull request open so that a code review can be performed within it.
0. Have fun!

*Note*: The git branches [backend-basic-setup][1] / [frontend-basic-setup][2]
contain a basic project setup that you can use if you like with the technologies
we routinely use at Talkdesk.
