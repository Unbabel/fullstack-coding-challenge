# Unbabel Fullstack Challenge

Hey :smile:

Welcome to our Fullstack Challenge repository. This README will guide you on how to participate in this challenge.

In case you are doing this to apply for our open positions for a Fullstack Developer make sure you first check the available jobs at [https://unbabel.com/jobs](https://unbabel.com/jobs)

Please fork this repo before you start working on the challenge. We will evaluate the code on the fork.

**FYI:** Please understand that this challenge is not decisive if you are applying to work at [Unbabel](https://unbabel.com/jobs). There are no right and wrong answers. This is just an opportunity for us both to work together and get to know each other in a more technical way.

## Challenge

We're going to build a very simple translation web app based on the Unbabel API.

You can find more info about the api at [https://developers.unbabel.com](https://developers.unbabel.com)

1) Request an API Key to your hiring manager or point of contact for the hiring process at Unbabel so you can use the API for this tutorial.  
2) Build a basic web app with a simple input field that takes an English (EN) input translates it to Spanish (ES).  
3) When a new translation is requested it should add to a list below the input field (showing one of three status: requested, pending or translated) - (note: always request human translation)   
4) The list should be dynamically ordered by the size of the translated messages   

#### Requirements
